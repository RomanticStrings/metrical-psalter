Praise the Lord, ye heavens a -- dore him;  
Praise him, an -- gels in the height;  
Sun and moon, re -- joice be -- fore him,  
Praise him, all ye stars and light.  
Praise the Lord, for he has spo -- ken;  
Worlds his might -- y voice o -- beyed:  
Laws, which nev -- er shall be bro -- ken,  
For their guid -- ance he has made.  
  
Praise the Lord, for he is glo -- rious;  
Nev -- er shall his pro -- mise fail;  
God has made his saints vic -- to -- rious;  
Sin and death shall not pre -- vail.  
Praise the God of our sal -- va -- tion;  
Hosts on high, his power pro -- claim;  
Heaven and earth and all cre -- a -- tion,  
Laud and mag -- ni -- fy his name!  
  
Wor -- ship, hon -- or, glo -- ry, bless -- ing,  
Lord, we of -- fer to thy name;  
Young and old, thy praise ex -- press -- ing,  
Join their Sav -- ior to pro -- claim;  
As the Saints in heaven a -- dore thee,  
We would bow be -- fore thy throne;  
As thy an -- gels serve be -- fore thee,  
So on earth thy will be done.
